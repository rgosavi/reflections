Version control rocks !
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I can go back to any version if i inadvertently add new undesirable behaviour to it. 
It can allow me to be more agile - try new stuff backtrack etc.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
+ only relevant/meaningful versions recorded
- can lose some work in progress to human error or system failure !

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

in wikipedia each document is often a single unit; code on the other hand has interdependencies.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log - shows commit history 
git diff - diffs between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

you can quickly back trace through changes to identify cause.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

for developing an android app.
